The Thief
=========

A 2D stealth based videogame.

The player takes on the role of being a thief. The thief can't be spotted by the guards, and after getting the treasure has exactly 10 seconds to escape.

This is the continuation of the game developed during the Ludum Dare. The theme was "10 seconds".
