The Thief:

    A by-contract thief, who steals for the highest bidder. He dislikes guns
  and physical violence, so when stealing he goes by undetected. But when
  things go wrong, all he can do is run, for he is unarmed, and badly trained
  for combat.

The Security Guard:

    A normal guy, trying to make a living. Probably has wife and kids, and
  just wants to get through the end of the month to pay the bills.
