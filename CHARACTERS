The Thief:

    A by-contract thief, who steals for the highest bidder. He dislikes guns
  and physical violence, so when stealing he goes by undetected. But when
  things go wrong, all he can do is run, for he is unarmed, and badly trained
  for combat.

The Lazy Guard:

    A lazy guy that loves his paycheck, but isn't willing to risk his life.
  So if he sees you, he'll chase you, but not for long. He tires himself
  rather quickly.

The Common Guard:

    A normal guy, trying to make a living. Probably has wife and kids, and
  just wants to get through the end of the month to pay the bills. If he sees
  you, he'll chase you. But the moment he stops seeing you, is the moment he
  stops caring about you.

The Specialist Guard:

    This is guard of the guards. He has an acute audition, and an even better
  vision. If he hear, smell or see you... You're dead meat. He'll chase you,
  and you haven't any chance whatsoever of escape. Don't get near these guys.

The Police:

    Sometimes something is so valuable that security guards aren't enough to
  protect a valuable object. So, enter the police. This guy isn't afraid of
  you. He has a gun and you haven't. And he is not afraid to shoot you dead.
  But because he eats too many donuts, he can't run that fast, and you can
  easily outrun him.

The Special Forces Soldier:

    If this guy is in the scene, you're in for serious trouble. He won't miss
  a shot if he sees you. For that reason reason, make sure he NEVER, EVER, sees
  you, hears you, smells you or even taste you... He and his buddies will make
  sure you'll never the see the sun shine tomorrow.
